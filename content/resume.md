## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Codemancers *(01/2024 – Present, Bangalore, India)*  

**DevOps Engineer**
- Designed and implemented fault-tolerant, highly available AWS/Azure infrastructure using
Terraform and Ansible, improving deployment accuracy, reducing configuration drift, and
accelerating rollout times, while integrating Vanta for continuous compliance monitoring to
support SOC 2 and ISO 27001 standards.
- Developed CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Argo CD, Gitlab CI and custom Helm charts to
automate deployment, testing, and rollback of Kubernetes applications, improving developer
velocity, deployment consistency, and reducing configuration errors.
- Deployed and managed a monitoring stack using Prometheus, Loki and Grafana across multiple
EKS clusters, improving observability; additionally, replaced traditional block storage for timeseries data with S3-backed object storage using Grafana Mimir, resulting in improved scalability
and cost efficiency.
- Enhanced infrastructure security by implementing Netbird VPN with Google SSO for secure remote
access and replacing long-lived credentials with temporary ones using OIDC, IRSA, Pod Identity,
and HashiCorp Vault to strengthen compliance and access control.
- Collaborated cross-functionally with developers, QA, and product teams to streamline release
processes, reduce deployment time, and improve delivery frequency and reliability.
- Performed seamless EKS cluster upgrades to maintain a secure, up-to-date Kubernetes
environment.
- Led the implementation of cloud-native technologies, including Karpenter for Kubernetes
autoscaling, CloudNativePG for database operations, fck-nat for cost-efficient networking, GitHub
Actions Runner Controller for CI/CD scalability, and External Secrets Operator for secure secret
management.

### Fantail Tech LLC *(09/2021 – 12/2023, Remote)*  

**DevOps Engineer**

- Designed and implemented a AWS cloud based product architecture achieving 99.9% uptime and fault tolerance.
- Engineered an automated backup and restoration system for Neo4j GraphQL Database servers, drastically reducing recovery time.
- Implemented CloudWatch and New Relic monitoring solutions, achieving better visibility into system performance and reducing incident response time.
- Implemented Snyk code review in CI pipeline to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in code.
- Migrated the Monolithic Alfresco Content Services Alfresco app to Docker Compose which reduced complexity and made platform upgrades easier.
- Streamlined CI/CD pipelines using Travis CI, enabling automated testing and deployment across environments.
