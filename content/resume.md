### Codemancers *(01/2024 – Present, Bangalore, India)*  
**DevOps Engineer**
- **Incident Response and Troubleshooting**: Addressed and performed root cause analysis (RCA) of production incidents and cross-platform issues involving OS, Networking, and Database in AWS/Azure environments.
- **Analysis, and Infrastructure Maintenance**: Continuously monitored, analyzed, and measured system health, availability, and latency using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo and Loki.
- **Cloud Infrastructure & Compliance**: Designed and managed AWS cloud infrastructure compliant with ISO/SOC2, ensuring security and scalability.
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced cloud compute and data transfer costs by 80% by implementing Karpenter autoscaler, GitHub Actions runner controller.
with spot instances, and replacing AWS NAT Gateway with FCK NAT.
- **Secure Remote Access**: Implemented a high-availability VPN solutions (OpenVPN/Netbird) to enable teams to securely access EKS clusters, CI/CD systems, and developer tools without exposing endpoints to the
public internet.
- **Annual DR Exercises**: Conducted full-scale disaster recovery drill to identify gaps, leading to infrastructure redesigns that reduced RTO by 40% and RPO by 75%. Implemented corrective measures like multi-region backups, automated snapshot validation, and failover DNS.
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Eliminated Long-Lived Credentials: Replaced static tokens/IAM keys with short-lived, dynamic secrets using AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), Azure Workload Identity, AWS Pod Identity, and Hashicorp Vault—reducing credential exposure risks by 90%. 
  - Automation: Streamlined infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions, reducing manual effort by 60%.
