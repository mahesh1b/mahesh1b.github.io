## Experience

### Codemancers *(01/2024 – Present, Bangalore, India)*  

**DevOps Engineer**

- **Grit Financial**
  - Designed and implemented fault-tolerant, highly available AWS infrastructure using Terraform and
Ansible, improving deployment accuracy, reducing configuration drift, and accelerating rollout
times, while integrating Vanta for continuous compliance monitoring to support SOC 2 and ISO
27001 standards.
  - Developed CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and custom Helm charts to automate deployment,
testing, and rollback of Kubernetes applications, improving developer velocity, deployment
consistency, and reducing configuration errors.
  - Conducted annual Disaster Recovery (DR) exercises, validating failover mechanisms and
identifying areas for infrastructure and process improvement.
  - Deployed and managed a monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana across multiple EKS
clusters, improving observability and reducing MTTD and MTTR; additionally, replaced traditional
block storage for time-series data with S3-backed object storage using Grafana Mimir, resulting in
improved scalability and cost efficiency.
  - Enhanced infrastructure security by implementing Netbird VPN with Google SSO for secure remote
access and replacing long-lived credentials with temporary ones using OIDC, IRSA, Pod Identity,
and HashiCorp Vault to strengthen compliance and access control.

- **Kris@Work**
  - Designed, implemented, and managed Azure cloud infrastructure using Terraform as
Infrastructure as Code (IaC), adhering to best practices for scalability, security, and cost-efficiency.
Services included Azure Virtual Networks, Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS),
Azure Blob Storage, Azure Database, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry.
  - Developed and maintained custom Helm charts for deploying microservices to AKS clusters,
integrating deployments with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, following industry best practices
for versioning, rollback, and environment segregation.
  - Implemented end-to-end observability and monitoring solutions using Prometheus, Grafana, and
Loki to track application and Kubernetes cluster performance, enabling proactive issue detection
and achieving a 99% system uptime.
  - Collaborated cross-functionally with developers, QA, and product teams to streamline release
processes, reduce deployment time, and improve delivery frequency and reliability.

- **Global Equine Productions**
  - Architected and implemented end-to-end application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform and
Ansible, following best practices for scalability, security, and high availability while improving
deployment accuracy, reducing drift, and accelerating rollout times.
  - Deployed and configured Argo CD for GitOps-based continuous delivery with canary deployment
support, and developed Helm charts to standardize EKS application rollouts, improving release
consistency, speed, and rollback safety.
  - Performed seamless EKS cluster upgrades to maintain a secure, up-to-date Kubernetes
environment, and deployed Prometheus Operator with Grafana Loki for enhanced observability,
enabling centralized monitoring and log aggregation across microservices.
  - Reduced EC2 compute costs by implementing Karpenter to efficiently autoscale workloads on spot
instances.

### Fantail Tech LLC *(09/2021 – 12/2023, Remote)*  

**DevOps Engineer**

- Designed and implemented a AWS cloud based product architecture achieving 99.9% uptime and
fault tolerance.
- Engineered an automated backup and restoration system for Neo4j GraphQL Database servers,
drastically reducing recovery time.
- Implemented CloudWatch and New Relic monitoring solutions, achieving better visibility into
system performance and reducing incident response time.
- Implemented Snyk code review in CI pipeline to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in code.
- Migrated the Monolithic Alfresco Content Services Alfresco app to Docker Compose which reduced
complexity and made platform upgrades easier.
- Streamlined CI/CD pipelines using Travis CI, enabling automated testing and deployment across
environments.
